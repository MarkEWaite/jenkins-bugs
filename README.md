# Jenkins Bug Verification
Public repository for Jenkins bug verification.

Many of the bug reports on the Jenkins git plugin and the Jenkins git client plugin 
need a repository which contains specific configurations to duplicate the bug.  This
repository captures some of those configurations in a way that is publicly visible
so that automated tests can use this repository.
