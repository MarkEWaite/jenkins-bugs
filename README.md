# [JENKINS-59497](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-59497) Reference repository ignored in Pipeline

Bug report says that the reference repository setting is ignored by Pipeline checkout.
I cannot duplicate the problem.
All the variations that I've tried have correctly used the reference repository.
