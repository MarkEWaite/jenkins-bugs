# [JENKINS-29977](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-29977) - Jenkins UI truncates commit summary message

The Jenkins UI truncates the summary message (first line) of the git
commits in the changes list.  It has done so since at least 2015 and is
believed to have been doing so since git plugin 2.0.
